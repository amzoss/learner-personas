A [learner persona][personas] is a short description of a typical learner. By
personalizing learners, personas help instructors figure out who they’re trying
to help and communicate that understanding to each other and to learners. Each
persona has general background, relevant prior knowledge or experience, the
learner’s perception of their needs, and any special considerations.  The
maintainers' notes for each workshop, tutorial, how-to guide, or reference
manual should explain who it's going to help and how. Any instructional material
should be designed to help 1–3 specific personas, and should be advertised to
them as meeting their perceived needs.

The personas below have been synthesized from ones created by RStudio staff and
certified instructors; comments and additions are very welcome.  Please note
that the domains in these personas (such as pharmacy or event management) are
meant to be placeholders: swap in another domain such as finance or logistics
as desired.
